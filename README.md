#JS Project

Learning JavaScript, HTML & CSS

It has been a while since I last worked hands-on with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I genuinely enjoyed revisiting and re-learning these foundational web technologies.

While I am still early in the process and not yet where I want to be, every journey begins with a first step—and consistent practice leads to progress and improvement over time.

I would like to give special credit to Shradha Khapra and her YouTube channel:

She has created an excellent JavaScript playlist that explains concepts in a clear and structured way. Although the content is in Hindi, it is very easy to follow and highly effective for beginners and those revisiting JavaScript fundamentals.

This project represents my commitment to continuous learning and strengthening my core web development skills.
